Core Development Kit

We’ve created the Core Development Kit to make it easier for you to get started
making frame walls. It includes all the objects we used to design our frame
walls; axles, wheels, frame spacers and most importantly the Core. We’ve also
included in the CDK a sample frame wall you can use to jumpstart your design.
This wall fits 65mm wheels, which is the maximum standard wheel size.

Terms of Use

The Core System is open source and free for you to use to pursue your frame
design dreams. We’re licensing the system under Creative Commons so you can use
it to design any frame walls you want. Feel free to print your frame wall
designs for personal use, sell your frame wall designs for others to print,
print your frame wall designs and sell them yourself, or give them away for
free. Please leave the Cores to us though, we are not licensing the Core design
for sale, only for use when designing frame walls.
